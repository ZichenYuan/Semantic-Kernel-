### Tips for crafting prompts
Specific Inputs Yield Specific Outputs: LLMs respond based on the input they receive. Crafting clear and specific prompts is crucial to get the desired output.

Experimentation is Key: You may need to iterate and experiment with different prompts to understand how the model interprets and generates responses. Small tweaks can lead to significant changes in outcomes.

Context Matters: LLMs consider the context provided in the prompt. You should ensure that the context is well-defined and relevant to obtain accurate and coherent responses.

Handle Ambiguity: Bear in mind that LLMs may struggle with ambiguous queries. Provide context or structure to avoid vague or unexpected results.

Length of Prompts: While LLMs can process both short and long prompts, you should consider the trade-off between brevity and clarity. Experimenting with prompt length can help you find the optimal balance.
